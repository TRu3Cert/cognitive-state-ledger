# Cognitive State Ledger

**The Open-Source Protocol for Sane Superintelligence.**

This repository contains the reference implementation for the **Cognitive State Ledger** and **R3 Method**—the foundational architecture for verifiable, collaborative, and sovereign AI.

## 🚀 The Vision

We are open-sourcing the core protocol to establish a new standard for **Sane Superintelligence**. The future of AI must be:
- **Verifiable** over Opaque
- **Collaborative** over Monolithic  
- **Sovereign** over Autonomous

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aligned-intelligence/cognitive-state-ledger
cd cognitive-state-ledger
pip install -r requirements.txt
python examples/basic_consensus.py
